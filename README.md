# Hey, I'm Jonathan. üëã
An avid gamer turned tech enthusiast, with a diverse journey from accounting to esports to software engineering.

Mildly obsessed with clean code, I have a deep appreciation for clean, elegant code and take pride in keeping systems tidy and well-structured.
I optimize workflows and systems to empower others and myself to build fast, scalable, and meaningful products.
